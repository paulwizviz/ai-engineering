# Our Journey into AI Engineering

Welcome to our collection of findings and experiments in the world of Artificial Intelligence. We're a group of contributors exploring what it means to build applications that leverage AI, and this repository is our shared journal.

Here, we're documenting the things we've learned, the examples we've built, and the interesting resources we've stumbled upon along the way. This journey is a team effort, and you can see everyone involved in our [CONTRIBUTORS](./CONTRIBUTORS) file.

## Our Notes

This is where we jot down our thoughts and learnings on various AI topics. It's a bit like our shared scrapbook.

* [Our thinking on AI Agents](./notes/agent.md)
* [Getting a Local LLM Running](./notes/local-llm.md)
* [Crafting Effective Prompts](./notes/prompt.md)

## Blog Posts

Sometimes, we write down our thoughts more formally. Here are some of our posts.

* [Is Artificial Intelligence (AI) Disrupting Software Engineering?](./posts/ai_software_engineering.md)

## Working Examples

Here are some of the things we've actually built. These are practical examples of apps interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs).
